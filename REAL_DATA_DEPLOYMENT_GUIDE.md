# 🚀 REAL DATA DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## **📊 Current Status**

### **✅ What's Working:**
- Environment variables added to Render ✅
- API is responding and healthy ✅
- Database connection working ✅
- Mock data endpoints working ✅

### **❌ What Needs Fixing:**
- API is still running mock code
- Real data endpoints not available
- Environment variables not being used

---

## **🔧 SOLUTION**

### **The Issue:**
The current deployment is using the mock API code instead of the real data API code. The environment variables are there, but the API doesn't have the endpoints to use them.

### **The Fix:**
We need to ensure the real data API code is deployed instead of the mock API.

## **🚀 DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Update Branch (Recommended)**
1. **Check current branch**: The `render.yaml` shows `branch: sge`
2. **Ensure real data code is in sge branch**: The real data endpoints need to be in the `sge` branch
3. **Trigger new deployment**: Push changes to trigger automatic deployment

### **Option 2: Switch Branch**
1. **Change render.yaml**: Update to use main branch or correct branch
2. **Redeploy**: Trigger new deployment with correct code

### **Option 3: Manual Deployment**
1. **Check Git status**: Ensure real data code is committed
2. **Force deployment**: Trigger manual deployment in Render

## **📋 CHECKLIST**

### **Before Deployment:**
- [ ] Verify environment variables in Render dashboard
- [ ] Check which branch has real data endpoints
- [ ] Ensure real data code is committed to correct branch
- [ ] Verify API endpoints exist in code

### **After Deployment:**
- [ ] Test health endpoint
- [ ] Test Instagram endpoints
- [ ] Test Google Analytics endpoints
- [ ] Verify real data is returned

---

## **🧪 EXPECTED ENDPOINTS**

### **Current (Mock API):**
- ✅ `/health` - Working
- ✅ `/api/v1/users/sge-team` - Working
- ❌ `/api/v1/instagram/*` - Not available
- ❌ `/api/v1/analytics/ga/*` - Not available

### **Expected (Real Data API):**
- ✅ `/health` - Should work
- ✅ `/api/v1/instagram/account` - Should return real Instagram data
- ✅ `/api/v1/instagram/followers` - Should return real follower count
- ✅ `/api/v1/analytics/ga/users` - Should return real Google Analytics data
- ✅ `/api/v1/analytics/ga/sessions` - Should return real session data

## **🎯 NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Check Git branch**: Which branch has the real data endpoints?
2. **Update render.yaml**: Ensure correct branch is deployed
3. **Trigger deployment**: Push changes or manually trigger deployment
4. **Test endpoints**: Verify real data is working

### **Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Test after deployment
curl https://shadow-goose-api.onrender.com/health
curl https://shadow-goose-api.onrender.com/api/v1/instagram/account
curl https://shadow-goose-api.onrender.com/api/v1/analytics/ga/users
```

## **📞 NEED HELP?**

### **Render Dashboard:**
- Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
- Check `shadow-goose-api` service
- Look at deployment logs
- Check environment variables

### **Git Status:**
- Check which branch is being deployed
- Ensure real data code is in the correct branch
- Verify API endpoints exist in the code

**Status: Environment variables ready, need to deploy real data API code.**
