# NAVIMPACT BRANDING UPDATE REPORT
**Date**: December 2024  
**Prepared by**: Alan McCarthy  
**Subject**: Critical Branding Correction - Shadow Goose â†’ NavImpact

---

## ðŸš¨ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Issue Identified**: The deployed application was incorrectly branded as "Shadow Goose Entertainment" instead of the correct "NavImpact" branding.

**Action Taken**: Immediate correction of all branding elements across backend API, frontend application, and deployment configuration.

**Impact**: Zero downtime - all changes deployed successfully with proper NavImpact branding.

---

## ðŸ“‹ DETAILED ANALYSIS

### **What Happened**

1. **Historical Context**: The project was originally developed under the working name "Shadow Goose Entertainment" (SGE) during the development phase.

2. **Branding Oversight**: During the transition from development to production deployment, the branding was not updated to reflect the final product name "NavImpact".

3. **Discovery**: The issue was identified when testing the production API endpoint, which returned "Shadow Goose Entertainment API" instead of the expected NavImpact branding.

### **Why This Occurred**

1. **Development Phase**: The codebase was initially created with placeholder branding for development purposes.

2. **Deployment Rush**: During the critical deployment phase to resolve production issues, the branding update was overlooked in favor of fixing technical deployment problems.

3. **Multiple Priorities**: The team was focused on resolving critical deployment failures (database connectivity, build errors, environment variables) and the branding correction was deprioritized.
