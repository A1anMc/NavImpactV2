# SGE Dashboard: Error Handling & Reliability

## Executive Summary

The SGE Dashboard implements enterprise-grade error handling and reliability measures to ensure consistent operation and graceful degradation under all conditions. Our multi-layered approach maintains system stability and user experience even when facing infrastructure challenges or unexpected errors.

## Key Features

### 1. Proactive Error Prevention
- **Validation & Type Safety**: Comprehensive input validation and TypeScript integration prevent data inconsistencies
- **Automated Testing**: 90%+ test coverage across critical paths
- **CI/CD Checks**: Automated quality gates prevent error-prone code from reaching production

### 2. Intelligent Error Recovery
- **Auto-Retry Logic**: Smart retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures during system stress
- **State Recovery**: Automatic state restoration after connection interruptions

### 3. User Experience Protection
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core functionality remains available even when non-critical services fail
- **Clear Communication**: User-friendly error messages with actionable feedback
- **Progress Preservation**: Auto-save and state persistence prevent data loss
