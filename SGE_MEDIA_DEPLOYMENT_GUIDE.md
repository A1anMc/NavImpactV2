   - Media type, duration, release date
   - Target audience, contributors
   - Production budget, thumbnail

3. **Distribution Tracking**: Log current platforms

   - Social media distribution
   - Current view counts and engagement

### **Expected Timeline**
- **Week 1**: Deploy and test system
- **Week 2**: Upload SGE's 4 projects
- **Week 3**: Add distribution data
- **Week 4**: Generate first impact report

## ðŸŽ¨ **User Experience**

### **SGE Team Workflow**
1. **Add Media Projects**: Create new media project entries
2. **Track Distribution**: Log where content is published
3. **Monitor Performance**: Add view counts and engagement
4. **Document Impact**: Capture stories and outcomes
5. **Generate Reports**: Create impact reports for funders

### **Dashboard Features**
- Overview metrics (total projects, views, distributions)
- Recent projects grid with quick actions
- Performance charts (placeholder for Phase 2)
- Recent impact stories display

---

## ðŸš¨ **Rollback Plan**

If issues occur during deployment:

### **Database Rollback**
```bash
# Rollback the SGE Media migration
alembic downgrade 20250127_sustainability
```

### **Code Rollback**
```bash
# Revert to previous stable version
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force origin main
```

### **Emergency Contacts**
- Database: Check Render PostgreSQL console
- Backend: Monitor Render logs
- Frontend: Check Vercel deployment status

*The SGE Media Module is ready for production deployment and will provide immediate value to SGE while establishing the foundation for future revenue-generating features.*

---

### 1. **Migration Not Applying**
- We pushed the SGE Media Module migration to production, but the SGE Media tables are still not being created on the Render database.
- The `/api/v1/sge-media-health` endpoint keeps returning:  
  `{"status":"pending","message":"SGE Media tables not found - migration needed","tables":[],"table_count":0}`

### 2. **What We Tried**
- We checked and fixed migration dependencies (so the SGE Media migration depends on the correct base migration).
- We simplified the migration to remove foreign key constraints, in case that was causing issues.
- We added print statements to the migration for debugging, hoping to see output in the Render logs.
- We committed and pushed these changes, triggering a new deployment (Render is set to run `alembic upgrade head` on deploy).

### 3. **What We Observed**
- The API is healthy (`/health` endpoint returns OK), so the backend is running.
- The SGE Media tables are still missing after each deployment.
- The simplified migration file (`20250127_add_sge_media_module_simple.py`) was deleted (possibly by Render or a cleanup process), but the main migration file remains.

### 4. **Possible Causes**
- **Migration is not being picked up or run by Alembic on Render.**
  - This could be due to a migration chain issue (Alembic thinks itâ€™s already at head, or the migration history is broken).
- **Alembic version table in the database is out of sync.**
- **A silent error during migration (not visible unless we check Render logs).**
- **File naming or dependency mismatch.**
- **The migration file is present locally but not in the deployed container.**

---

## **Next Steps / How to Fix**

### **A. Check Render Deployment Logs**
- The most direct way to see whatâ€™s happening is to check the Render backend service logs for any Alembic errors or skipped migrations.
- Look for lines mentioning `alembic upgrade head`, errors, or skipped migrations.

### **B. Confirm Alembic Version in DB**
- The Alembic version table (`alembic_version`) in the database may be stuck at an old revision, so new migrations are ignored.
- If you have access to the Render database (via a SQL client or Renderâ€™s web console), run:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM alembic_version;
  ```
  - This will show the current migration revision applied.

### **C. Manual Migration**
- If the migration is not being picked up, you may need to run:
  ```bash
  alembic upgrade head
  ```
  - Directly on the Render backend shell (if available).

### **D. Migration Chain**
- Ensure that the migration chain is correct:
  - The `down_revision` in each migration matches the `revision` of the previous migration.
  - No duplicate or missing revision IDs.

---

## **Summary**
- The migration is not being applied on Render, so the SGE Media tables are not created.
- The backend is running, but the new features are blocked by the missing tables.
- The next step is to check the Render backend logs and/or the Alembic version in the production database to diagnose why the migration is not running.

**Would you like instructions on how to check the Render logs or the Alembic version table? Or do you want to try running the migration manually on Render?**
