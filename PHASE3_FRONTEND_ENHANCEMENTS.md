  - Spacing and layout system
  - Animation system with performance optimizations
  - Focus styles for accessibility
  - Hardware acceleration utilities
  - Utility functions for color contrast and responsive design

#### 3. **Advanced Search & Filter System (MY ENHANCEMENT)**
- ✅ **Search Hook** (`frontend/src/hooks/useSearch.ts`)
  - Fuzzy search with configurable thresholds
  - Advanced filtering with multiple operators
  - Real-time highlighting of search results
  - Performance tracking and optimization
  - Virtualization support for large datasets
  - Search suggestions with autocomplete
  - Debounced search with configurable timing

## 📊 COMPARISON: Before vs After

### **Before (Basic Hooks)**
```typescript
// Basic API call
const [data, setData] = useState([])
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  setLoading(true)
  fetch('/api/grants')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setData(data))
    .finally(() => setLoading(false))
}, [])
```

### **After (Enhanced Hooks + MY ADDITIONS)**
```typescript
// Advanced API hook with performance monitoring
const { data, isLoading, error, performance, cacheStatus } = useApiData({
  endpoint: '/api/grants',
  cacheConfig: {
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    retryCount: 3
  },
  onPerformance: (metrics) => {
    console.log(`Search took ${metrics.duration}ms`)
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    if (error.category === 'network') {
      // Show offline indicator
    }
  }
})

// Advanced search with fuzzy matching
const { results, searchTerm, setSearchTerm, performance } = useSearch({
  data: grants,
  searchFields: ['title', 'description', 'industry_focus'],
  fuzzySearch: true,
  highlightResults: true,
  debounceMs: 300
})
```
