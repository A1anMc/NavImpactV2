# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS REPORT

## **📊 Current Status**

### **✅ What's Working:**
- Environment variables added to Render
- Mock API is running and responding
- Database connection is working
- Frontend is deployed

### **❌ What Needs Fixing:**
- API is still running mock endpoints
- Real data endpoints don't exist in current deployment
- Environment variables not being used by current API

---

## **🔧 ISSUE ANALYSIS**

### **Problem 1: Wrong API Endpoints**
- **Current**: Mock API endpoints
- **Needed**: Real data API endpoints
- **Solution**: Deploy the correct API code

### **Problem 2: Environment Variables**
- **Status**: Added to Render dashboard
- **Issue**: Not being used by current deployment
- **Solution**: Ensure API reads environment variables

---

## **🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED**

### **Step 1: Check Current Branch**
The `render.yaml` shows deployment from `sge` branch, but real data endpoints might be in main branch.

### **Step 2: Verify Environment Variables**
Check if environment variables are properly configured in Render dashboard.

### **Step 3: Deploy Correct API**
Ensure the API with real data endpoints is deployed.

---

## **📋 CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Verify environment variables in Render dashboard
- [ ] Check which branch is being deployed
- [ ] Ensure real data API endpoints exist
- [ ] Trigger new deployment if needed
- [ ] Test real data endpoints

---

## **🧪 TESTING**

### **Current Endpoints (Mock):**
- ✅ `/health` - Working
- ❌ `/api/v1/instagram/*` - Not found
- ❌ `/api/v1/analytics/ga/*` - Not found

### **Expected Endpoints (Real Data):**
- `/api/v1/instagram/account`
- `/api/v1/instagram/followers`
- `/api/v1/analytics/ga/users`
- `/api/v1/analytics/ga/sessions`

---

## **🎯 NEXT STEPS**

1. **Check Render Dashboard** - Verify environment variables are added
2. **Check Git Branch** - Ensure correct branch is deployed
3. **Trigger Deployment** - If needed, trigger new deployment
4. **Test Endpoints** - Verify real data endpoints work

## **📞 NEED HELP?**

### **Render Dashboard:**
- Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
- Check `shadow-goose-api` service
- Verify environment variables are present
- Check deployment logs

### **Git Status:**
- Check which branch is being deployed
- Ensure real data code is in the correct branch

**Status: Environment variables added, but API needs to be updated to use them.**
