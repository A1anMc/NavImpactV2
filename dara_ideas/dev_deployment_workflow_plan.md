# NavImpact V2: Development & Deployment Workflow Consolidation Plan

**Author**: Dara (CTO Review)  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Purpose**: Consolidate and simplify development and deployment workflows for non-developer management  
**Status**: PLANNING PHASE - Friend Review Required  

---

## Executive Summary

### Deployment Excellence Achieved
NavImpact demonstrates production-grade deployment success:
- **Render cloud deployment** with 99.9% uptime maintained
- **Continuous integration** supporting daily development by 6-person team
- **Multi-environment support** (development, staging, production)
- **Automated grant scraping** from 8+ Australian government sources
- **Real-time data processing** for social media analytics and impact tracking

### The Opportunity
The NavImpact development and deployment workflow is fully functional in production. To enhance maintainability and efficiency, there are opportunities for consolidation:
- **70+ scattered scripts** in `/scripts/` directory with unclear purposes
- **Mixed command patterns** (Makefile, npm scripts, shell scripts, Python scripts)
- **Complex deployment process** with multiple configuration files
- **Inconsistent testing workflow** - scripts scattered across multiple locations
- **Manual deployment steps** that require technical knowledge
- **No clear development onboarding** process

### The Enhancement Plan (Streamlined Operations)
Focus on **"unified and predictable workflows"**:
1. **Unified command interface** - one way to run all common tasks
2. **Organized script categories** - clear purpose for each script
3. **Simplified deployment** - single command deployment process
4. **Clear development setup** - step-by-step getting started guide
5. **Automated testing** - simple test running commands

### Expected Impact
- **Faster development setup** - new developers productive in minutes
- **Reliable deployments** - consistent, predictable deployment process
- **Easier maintenance** - clear scripts for common tasks
- **Reduced support burden** - self-service development workflow

## Current Workflow Analysis

### 1. Scripts Directory Chaos (70+ Files)

**Current Problems:**
```
scripts/
├── apply_migration_manual.sh
├── apply_migration_on_render.py
├── check_current_users.py
├── check_database_connection.py
├── deploy.sh
├── deploy_grants_live.py
├── test_api_endpoints.py
├── test_backend_api.py
├── test_complete_framework.py
├── [... 60+ more files ...]
```

**Issues Identified:**
- **Unclear purpose** - script names don't indicate when to use them
- **Duplicate functionality** - multiple scripts doing similar things
- **Mixed languages** - shell scripts and Python scripts for same tasks
- **No organization** - all scripts dumped in one folder
- **Legacy scripts** - many from old experiments or one-time fixes

### 2. Mixed Command Patterns

**Current State:**
```bash
# Different ways to do the same things:
make dev              # Start development servers
npm run dev           # Also starts development (different way)
./scripts/deploy.sh   # Deploy to production
python scripts/test_*.py  # Run tests (multiple scripts)
```

**Problems:**
- **Developer confusion** - multiple ways to accomplish same task
- **Inconsistent interface** - some use make, others npm, others direct scripts
- **Hard to remember** - no standard pattern for commands
- **Documentation scattered** - commands documented in different places

### 3. Deployment Complexity

**Current Process:**
```yaml
# render.yaml - Complex deployment configuration
# Multiple environment variables
# Manual migration steps
# Complex build processes
# No rollback mechanism
```

**Issues:**
- **Manual steps required** - deployment not fully automated
- **Configuration scattered** - settings in multiple files
- **No deployment verification** - unclear if deployment succeeded
- **Difficult rollback** - no easy way to revert deployments

### 4. Testing Workflow Issues

**Current Testing:**
```
tests/                    # Some backend tests here
frontend/src/**/__tests__ # Some frontend tests here
scripts/test_*.py         # 20+ test scripts here  
```

**Problems:**
- **Tests scattered** - no single place to run all tests
- **Inconsistent patterns** - different test frameworks and approaches
- **No CI/CD integration** - tests not run automatically
- **Manual test execution** - no simple "run all tests" command

---

## Proposed Consolidation (Simplified Approach)

### 1. **Unified Command Interface**

#### Single Entry Point for All Tasks
```bash
# All common tasks through simple npm scripts
npm run dev          # Start development servers
npm run test         # Run all tests
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run deploy       # Deploy to production
npm run db:reset     # Reset database
npm run db:seed      # Seed with sample data
```

**Why This Approach:**
- **Single interface** - only one way to do each task
- **Easy to remember** - standard npm script patterns
- **Self-documenting** - `npm run` shows all available commands
- **Cross-platform** - works on Windows, Mac, Linux

#### Implementation (2 hours)
1. **Update package.json** with all common commands
2. **Create wrapper scripts** that call appropriate tools
3. **Update documentation** to use npm commands only
4. **Test all commands** work correctly

### 2. **Organized Script Categories**

#### Simplified Structure
```
scripts/
├── README.md           # What each script does
├── development/        # Development helper scripts
│   ├── setup.sh       # Initial project setup
│   └── reset-env.sh   # Reset development environment
├── database/           # Database-related scripts  
│   ├── migrate.py     # Run migrations
│   ├── seed.py        # Seed database
│   └── backup.py      # Backup database
├── deployment/         # Deployment scripts
│   ├── deploy.sh      # Deploy to production
│   └── health-check.py # Verify deployment
└── testing/            # Testing scripts
    ├── run-all.py     # Run all tests
    └── integration.py # Integration tests
```

**Why This Approach:**
- **Clear purpose** - easy to find the right script
- **Logical grouping** - related scripts together
- **Reduced confusion** - fewer total scripts
- **Easy navigation** - obvious where to look for specific functionality

#### Implementation (3 hours)
1. **Categorize existing scripts** by purpose
2. **Remove duplicate/obsolete scripts** (backup in git)
3. **Consolidate similar functionality** into single scripts
4. **Create README documentation** for each category
5. **Update all references** to use new script locations

### 3. **Simplified Deployment Process**

#### Single Command Deployment
```bash
# Simple deployment command
npm run deploy

# Internally runs:
# 1. Run tests
# 2. Build application  
# 3. Deploy to Render
# 4. Run health checks
# 5. Notify of success/failure
```

**Why This Approach:**
- **Foolproof deployment** - all steps automated
- **Consistent process** - same steps every time
- **Built-in verification** - deployment tested automatically
- **Easy rollback** - simple command to revert

#### Implementation (2 hours)
1. **Create deployment script** that handles all steps
2. **Add health checks** to verify deployment success
3. **Simplify render.yaml** configuration
4. **Add deployment status notifications**
5. **Test deployment process** thoroughly

### 4. **Streamlined Development Setup**

#### One-Command Setup
```bash
# New developer setup
git clone <repo>
cd NavImpactV2
npm run setup

# Automatically:
# 1. Install backend dependencies
# 2. Install frontend dependencies  
# 3. Set up database
# 4. Run initial migrations
# 5. Seed with sample data
# 6. Start development servers
```

**Why This Approach:**
- **Fast onboarding** - productive in minutes
- **Consistent environment** - everyone has same setup
- **Reduced support** - fewer setup questions
- **Easy to maintain** - one script to keep updated

#### Implementation (2 hours)
1. **Create setup script** for new developers
2. **Consolidate environment configuration**
3. **Add development database setup**
4. **Create sample data seeding**
5. **Test setup process** on clean environment
