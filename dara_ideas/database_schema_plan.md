# NavImpact V2: Database Schema & Migrations Consolidation Plan

**Author**: Dara (CTO Review)  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Purpose**: Clean up database schema and migration history for simplified maintenance  
**Status**: PLANNING PHASE - Friend Review Required  

---

## Executive Summary

### Production Database Success
The NavImpact database successfully supports enterprise-level operations:
- **PostgreSQL V3** with 38+ clean migrations deployed to production
- **Shadow Goose Entertainment data** including 6 team members and 4 active media projects
- **Grant management system** supporting applications worth $500K+ in funding
- **Victorian framework tracking** with complete UN SDG integration
- **Real-time analytics** processing social media data for OKR 4.1 tracking

### The Opportunity
The NavImpact database is fully operational in production. To optimize performance and maintainability, there are opportunities for enhancement:
- **Disabled model relationships** (Grant ↔ User relationships commented out)
- **Inconsistent migration history** with backup and duplicate migrations
- **Mixed database patterns** - some FK constraints disabled, others working
- **Legacy table structures** from previous iterations (SGE media modules)
- **Orphaned migration files** that don't align with current models
- **Performance issues** - missing indexes and inefficient queries

### The Enhancement Plan (Database Optimization)
Focus on **"optimized data foundation"**:
1. **Clean migration history** - single, clear path from empty database to current schema
2. **Restore proper relationships** - fix commented-out model relationships  
3. **Consistent naming patterns** - all tables and columns follow same conventions
4. **Essential indexes** - fast queries for common operations
5. **Simple backup/restore** - easy database maintenance

### Expected Impact
- **Faster application performance** - proper indexes and relationships
- **Easier data management** - consistent patterns throughout
- **Reliable migrations** - clean upgrade path for database changes
- **Better data integrity** - proper foreign key constraints

---

## Current Database Analysis

### 1. Disabled Model Relationships

**Current Problems:**
```python
# app/models/grant.py
class Grant(Base):
    # Relationships disabled due to technical debt
    created_by_id = Column(Integer, nullable=True)  # No FK constraint
    # created_by = relationship("User", back_populates="grants")  # Commented out
    
    # tags = relationship("Tag", secondary="grant_tags", back_populates="grants")  # Disabled
```

**Issues Identified:**
- **Data integrity lost** - no foreign key constraints to prevent orphaned records
- **Query complexity** - manual joins required instead of using relationships
- **Application bugs** - easier to create invalid data references
- **Performance issues** - missing relationship optimizations

### 2. Migration History Chaos

**Current State:**
```
alembic/versions/
├── 000_create_user_table.py
├── 001_create_tasks_table.py
├── 001_2_create_project_table.py          # Unclear numbering
├── 001_5_create_grants_table.py           # Mixed numbering scheme
├── 001_fresh_database_setup.py            # Duplicate functionality
├── 20250127_add_sge_media_module_backup.py    # Backup files
├── 20250127_add_sge_media_module_backup2.py   # More backups
├── sge_media_v1.py                         # Unclear version
```

**Problems:**
- **Unclear upgrade path** - which migrations actually need to run?
- **Duplicate functionality** - multiple migrations doing similar things
- **Backup migrations** - backup files mixed with real migrations
- **Inconsistent naming** - no clear convention for migration names

### 3. Database Schema Inconsistencies

**Current Issues:**
```sql
-- Some tables have proper relationships
users.mentor_id -> users.id (works correctly)

-- Others have broken relationships  
grants.created_by_id -> users.id (no FK constraint)

-- Mixed indexing patterns
CREATE INDEX ix_grants_deadline ON grants (deadline);  -- Some indexed
-- grants.industry_focus -- Not indexed despite frequent queries
```

**Impact:**
- **Slow queries** - missing indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Data inconsistency** - orphaned records possible
- **Maintenance difficulty** - unclear which patterns to follow

### 4. Legacy Schema Components

**Current Legacy Tables:**
```python
# Models that may no longer be needed:
- sge_media.py (SGE media module - unclear if active)
- sustainability.py (Sustainability module - unclear usage)
- notion_integration.py (Notion integration - may be unused)
```

**Problems:**
- **Unclear purpose** - models exist but unclear if they're used
- **Migration complexity** - migrations for unused features
- **Performance overhead** - indexes and constraints for unused tables

---

## Proposed Consolidation (Simplified Approach)

### 1. **Clean Migration History**

#### Single, Clear Migration Path
```python
# Create one definitive migration that represents current schema
# alembic/versions/20250805_consolidated_schema.py

def upgrade():
    """Create the complete current schema in one migration."""
    # Users table with all current fields
    create_users_table()
    
    # Projects table with proper relationships
    create_projects_table()
    
    # Grants table with restored relationships
    create_grants_table()
    
    # Tasks table with proper indexes
    create_tasks_table()
    
    # Essential indexes for performance
    create_performance_indexes()
```

**Why This Approach:**
- **Clear upgrade path** - one migration creates entire schema
- **No confusion** - obvious what the current schema should be
- **Fast fresh installs** - new databases created quickly
- **Easy troubleshooting** - single migration to check

#### Implementation (3 hours)
1. **Create consolidated migration** representing current schema
2. **Archive old migrations** (keep for history, don't run)
3. **Test migration** on fresh database
4. **Verify all models work** with new migration

### 2. **Restore Model Relationships**

#### Fix Commented-Out Relationships
```python
# app/models/grant.py
class Grant(Base):
    # Restore proper foreign key relationship
    created_by_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=True)
    created_by = relationship("User", back_populates="created_grants")
    
    # Restore tag relationships if tags are used
    tags = relationship("Tag", secondary="grant_tags", back_populates="grants")
```

**Why This Approach:**
- **Data integrity** - foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- **Simplified queries** - can use relationship properties instead of manual joins
- **Better performance** - SQLAlchemy can optimize relationship queries
- **Clearer code** - relationships make intent obvious

#### Implementation (2 hours)
1. **Identify all commented relationships** in models
2. **Create migration** to add missing foreign key constraints
3. **Update model classes** to restore relationships
4. **Test all affected functionality** still works

### 3. **Consistent Database Patterns**

#### Standardize All Tables
```python
# Standard pattern for all models:
class StandardModel(Base):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, server_default=func.now(), nullable=False)
    updated_at = Column(DateTime, server_default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())
    
    # Proper foreign key constraints
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False)
    user = relationship("User", back_populates="related_items")
```

**Why This Approach:**
- **Predictable patterns** - all tables work the same way
- **Easy maintenance** - know what to expect in every table
- **Consistent performance** - same indexing patterns everywhere
- **Clear relationships** - obvious how tables connect

#### Implementation (2 hours)
1. **Review all model classes** for consistency
2. **Create migration** to standardize table patterns
3. **Add missing created_at/updated_at** columns where needed
4. **Ensure consistent indexing** on all tables

### 4. **Performance Optimization**

#### Essential Indexes for Common Queries
```sql
-- Indexes for frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX ix_grants_industry_focus ON grants (industry_focus);
CREATE INDEX ix_grants_location_eligibility ON grants (location_eligibility);
CREATE INDEX ix_grants_status_deadline ON grants (status, deadline);
CREATE INDEX ix_tasks_status_assigned_to ON tasks (status, assigned_to_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_projects_owner_status ON projects (owner_id, status);
```

**Why This Approach:**
- **Faster queries** - common searches execute quickly
- **Better user experience** - pages load faster
- **Reduced server load** - efficient database usage
- **Scalable performance** - handles more users/data

#### Implementation (1 hour)
1. **Identify frequently queried columns** from application code
2. **Create indexes** for common query patterns
3. **Test query performance** before and after
4. **Monitor index usage** to ensure they're helpful

   - Identify inconsistencies in naming conventions
   - Find tables missing created_at/updated_at columns
   - Check for inconsistent foreign key patterns

2. **Standardize table patterns** (60 minutes)
   ```python
   # Ensure all tables have consistent structure:
   class StandardModel(Base):
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       created_at = Column(DateTime, server_default=func.now())
       updated_at = Column(DateTime, server_default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())
   ```
